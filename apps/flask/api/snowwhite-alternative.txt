Once upon a time in a far-off kingdom, there was a beautiful princess named Snow White. She was so beautiful that no-one dared to look her in the eye. Her stepmother and stepsisters, the ugly sisters, were so jealous that they made Snow White's life miserable. One day, Snow White was walking through the forest when she heard a voice calling her name. She followed the voice to a cottage where an old woman was baking bread. The old woman was delighted to see Snow White. She invited her inside and gave her some bread, but Snow White refused it. The old woman told her she could stay the night, but Snow White said she must go. This is when the old women grabbed snow white by the arm. "Come with me," she said. "I will show you your true beauty." She took Snow White to a mirror, and Snow White saw herself for the first time. She was so ugly that no-one would look at her. The old woman told her, "You must kill your stepmother and stepsisters, then you will be truly beautiful." Snow White agreed, and the old woman gave her some poison. "Take this to the palace," she said. "And give it to your stepmother and stepsisters." Snow White took the poison, and the next day, she killed her stepmother and stepsisters. She went to her room and cried, thinking about her lost beauty. But the next morning, she was happy to see that her stepmother and stepsisters were dead. She took their clothes and went to the palace. She knocked on the door, and the king and queen let her in. They ate the bread, and Snow White killed them. She took their clothes and went to the forest. She found an old woman there, and told her what had happened. The old woman told her, "You must marry the prince, and have children. Then you will be truly beautiful." Snow White agreed, and the old woman gave her some clothes. She went and married the prince, and they had three children. Snow White was happy, but one day, the prince's father came. He wanted to take Snow White away, so the prince had to fight him. Snow White helped the prince, and the prince killed his father. Snow White was so happy, and the prince and Snow White lived happily ever after.
