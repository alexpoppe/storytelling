Once upon a time in a far-off kingdom, there was a beautiful princess named Snow White. She had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony. Snow White's stepmother, the queen, was very jealous of her beauty and wanted to be the most beautiful in the land. 

One day, the queen ordered a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. But the huntsman fell in love with her and couldn't bring himself to kill Snow White. Instead, he locked her in a glass coffin and took her to a cottage in the forest. 

There, Snow White lived with the seven dwarfs, who were miners. They loved her very much, and they took care of her. Snow White was very happy there, but the queen was furious. She sent a bird to spy on Snow White, and the bird reported back to the queen that Snow White was still alive. 

The queen was furious, and she made another plan. She disguised herself as an old woman and came to Snow White's cottage. She told Snow White that if she went into the forest, she would find a beautifulin love with her. If Snow White agreed, the queen would let her go. 

Snow White agreed, and the queen let her go. Snow White walked into the forest, and the queen followed her. But the queen couldn't keep up, and when she stopped to rest, she fell asleep. 

When the queen woke up, she was very upset.  She couldn't find Snow White. She ran back to the cottage and told the dwarfs what had happened. The dwarfs sent one of the dwarfs into the forest to find Snow White. 

The dwarf found Snow White, and he brought her back. The queen was very angry, and she locked Snow White in the cottage again. But Snow White escaped. She went to her stepmother's castle and told her that the queen had locked her in the cottage. 

The queen was very angry, and she sent a hunter to kill Snow White. But the hunter fell in love with Snow White, and he couldn't bring himself to kill Snow White. Instead, he brought her back.
